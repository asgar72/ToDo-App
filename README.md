# ToDo-App
The ToDo Timer App is designed for noting tasks to be done later, allowing users to assign priorities to these tasks. Users can update or delete ToDo items, as well as sort them based on priority.
Additionally, the app features a Stopwatch tab where users can start the countdown of minutes by clicking, and then stop it by clicking again. This functionality allows users to measure time intervals easily.
